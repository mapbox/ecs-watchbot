## Logging

Each Watchbot stack will write all its logs to a single CloudWatch LogGroup. The [awscli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/index.html) or [cwlogs](https://github.com/mapbox/cwlogs) are a couple of tools that can be used to view log events in a LogGroup.

If your host EC2s **are not** built from [ECS-optimized AMIs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html), make sure that the `awslogs` driver is enabled on the ecs-agent by setting the following agent configuration:

```
ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS=["json-file","awslogs"]
```

See [the AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_awslogs.html) for more information.

## Custom metrics

Custom metrics are collected under the namespace `Mapbox/ecs-watchbot`. They are mined via filters on CloudWatch logs, and can help you learn about the state of your Watchbot stack. Each custom metric is suffixed with your stack's name, e.g. `-MyWatchbotStack`.

Metric | Description | Statistics
--- | --- | ---
**WorkerErrors** | The total number of failed workers per minute. High levels of this error trigger the `WorkerErrors` alarm | Sum
**MessageReceives** | A metric collected for every received message that indicates how many times the message has been pulled from the queue | Maximum
**WorkerDuration** | The amount of time taken by a worker to run a task | `Average`, `Minimum` and `Maximum`
