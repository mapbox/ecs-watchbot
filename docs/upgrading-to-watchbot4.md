# Migrating from Watchbot 3 to Watchbot 4
## Examples:

- https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-conex/pull/130
- https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-telephone/pull/8


## Steps:
- Move the CMD in Dockerfile to the `command` option in the cloudformation template
- Install watchbotâ€™s binary with `wget` in your Dockerfile:

```
# The `<os>` can be `linux`, `macosx`, `windows`, depending on what you're running on your container.
# The `<master-sha>` can be 
# - A sha on https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-watchbot/tree/master that is more recent than `7fc31c2fe5d64d053e6edc1711697f654645dd97`
# - A tag on https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-watchbot/tree/master that is more recent than 

    RUN wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/watchbot-binaries/<os>/<master-ref>/watchbot
    RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/watchbot
```


- Change the `workers` parameter to `maxSize`. Note that due to the way we divide the maxSize by ten to determine scaling increments, `maxSize` needs to be a hard-coded number and cannot be a `Fn::Ref` object.
- Decide if you want your service to have a `minSize` other than 0.
- Remove all usage of the deprecated `watchbot-log` library and the `watchbot.log` call.
