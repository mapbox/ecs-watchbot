### 9.0.1

-  Bug fix: TotalMessagesLambda now working as expected; watchbot stacks now scaling down when no tasks in queue
-  Move from aws-sdk v2 to v3

### 9.0.0

-  Breaking change: use Node 18 for lambdas and binaries going forward

### 8.0.1

- Fix tests that were broken in the 8.0.0 release for some reason
- Force artifacts to use Node 14 now that it defaults to 16
- Update @mapbox/watchbot-progress to address vulnerabilities

### 8.0.0

- Add support for JSON structured logging via the 'structuredLogging' boolean option (defaults to off)
- Breaking change: use Node 14 for lambdas and binaries going forward

### 7.0.0

- Breaking change: use Node 12 for lambdas and binaries going forward

### 6.1.1

- Fix bug with `watchbot-dead-letter` command's fetching of recent logs (https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-watchbot/issues/350)
- Fix dashboard widget for showing running/desired/pending tasks (https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-watchbot/issues/351)
- Fix issue causing task scaledown on deployment (https://github.com/mapbox/ecs-watchbot/issues/349)

### 6.1.0

- Adds `fargatePublicIp` option. Its default value is `'DISABLED'`, so default behavior is no different than in 6.0.0, but now the property is adjustable.

### 6.0.0

- Adds the `capacity`, `fargateSecurityGroups`, and `fargateSubnets` options, which can be used to run tasks on Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity, instead of EC2 — which was the only option before and remains the default.
  - Switching `capacity` values can be disruptive. Switching between `EC2` and `FARGATE` or between `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` will cause the ECS service to be replaced during the CloudFormation update: a new service will be created, then the old service will be deleted. You cannot switch between `EC2` and `FARGATE_SPOT` without deleting and re-creating the CloudFormation stack; but you can make the transition with updates through a multi-step deployment: first change `EC2` to `FARGATE`, then change `FARGATE` to `FARGATE_SPOT`, or vice versa.
- If you set the option `reservations.cpu` lower than `128`, that will no longer be raised up to `128` in the output template. This was never done before if your `reservations.cpu` value was a CloudFormation intrinsic function.

### 5.0.0

-  Sets `PropagateTags` to `TASK_DEFINITION` on the ECS Service. If you are on the old ARN and the AWS account you are in has opted into the new format this version move you to the new ARN format by replacing your current service with a new one.

**ECS Service**

- Old: arn:aws:ecs:region:account-id:service/service-name
- New: arn:aws:ecs:region:account-id:service/cluster-name/service-name

**ECS Task**

- Old: arn:aws:ecs:region:account-id:task/task-id
- New: arn:aws:ecs:region:account-id:task/cluster-name/task-id

### 4.0.0

- Major revamp of watchbot internals. (refs #184). The system now:
  - Relies on an ECS service for scaling
  - Provides users metrics on cpu and memory utilization of all containers
  - Re-uses the same containers to process multiple jobs, reducing overhead

### 3.5.1

- Clearer error messages from the CLI tool for bad user input.

### 3.5.0

- Adds a log message if the watcher receives an SQS message that it has already launched a task for, and is still waiting to learn whether that task succeeded or failed.
- Upon receiving a duplicate message, the watcher checks if the in-flight task is in `PENDING` state. If so, it stops the task and returns the message to SQS for a retry.

### 3.4.1

  - LogGroup names are now `${stack-name}-${region}-${prefix}`, where `prefix` defaults to `watchbot` if not otherwise specified.

### 3.0.0

- **BREAKING** changes to the format with which CloudWatch LogGroups and streams are named. These should be considered breaking changes because upgrading a stack from v2.x to v3.x in-place will result in CloudFormation conflicts. Circumvent the conflicts by manually deleting the existing log group before running the CloudFormation update.
  - LogGroup names are now `${stack-name}-${region}`
  - Streams are now prefixed with `${service-version}` (a GitSha in most cases)

### 2.5.2

### 2.2.0

- `CannotStartContainerError`, `CannotPullContainerError` and `DockerTimeoutError` errors do not cause notifications when AlarmOnEveryError is set

### 2.1.1

- Removes `-event-target` from the ID of the cloudwatch events filter to make it shorter. refs #119

### 2.1.0

- fixes a bug in the changelog
- consolidates CLI commands into a single `watchbot` command
- adds a CLI command for interacting with the dead letter queue. **Note** that you cannot use the CLI unless you're working with a 2.1.0+ stack.

### 2.0.0

- fixes a bug that wouldn't have allowed you to disable exponential backoff
- returns `task.container[n].reason` as `reason` when task finishes, if available
- adds a second SQS queue used for the watcher's internal tracking of CloudWatch task state-change events
- adds ephemeral, or non-persistent, volume compatibility (see [AWS's task data volume documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html))
- adds mount point object compatibility for cloudfriend operators, and any other operators that use semicolons and commas
- adds a `worker-capacity` script to estimate how many additional worker tasks can be placed in your service's cluster at its current capacity
- adds CloudWatch metrics for worker errors (non-zero exit codes), failed worker container placement, worker duration, watcher concurrency, and message receive counts
- adds an alarm for number of worker errors in 60s, configurable through `watchbot.template(options)` `.errorThreshold`. Defaults to alarms after 10 failures per minute.
- drops polling of DescribeTasks API to learn when workers are completed
- **BREAKING** removes cluster resource polling - workers will try to be placed and fail instead of avoiding placement attempts
- **BREAKING** by default, watchbot no longer sends notification emails each time a worker errors. You can opt-in to this behavior by setting `watchbot.template(options)` `.alarmOnEachFailure: true`.
- **BREAKING** no longer sends notifications on error interacting with SQS. Instead watchbot silently proceeds.
- **BREAKING** watcher log format has changed. Now watcher logs print JSON objects
- **BREAKING** removes `.notifyAfterRetries` option
- **BREAKING** removes `.backoff` option. Workers are always retried with exponential backoff
- **BREAKING** adds a dead letter queue. Messages received more than 14 times by a watcher container will be sent to this queue. Any visible messages in this queue will trip an alarm.
