### unreleased

- fixes a bug in the changelog
- consolidates CLI commands into a single `watchbot` command
- adds a CLI command for interacting with the dead letter queue

### 2.0.0

- fixes a bug that wouldn't have allowed you to disable exponential backoff
- returns `task.container[n].reason` as `reason` when task finishes, if available
- adds a second SQS queue used for the watcher's internal tracking of CloudWatch task state-change events
- adds ephemeral, or non-persistent, volume compatibility (see [AWS's task data volume documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html))
- adds mount point object compatibility for cloudfriend operators, and any other operators that use semicolons and commas
- adds a `worker-capacity` script to estimate how many additional worker tasks can be placed in your service's cluster at its current capacity
- adds CloudWatch metrics for worker errors (non-zero exit codes), failed worker container placement, worker duration, watcher concurrency, and message receive counts
- adds an alarm for number of worker errors in 60s, configurable through `watchbot.template(options)` `.errorThreshold`. Defaults to alarms after 10 failures per minute.
- drops polling of DescribeTasks API to learn when workers are completed
- **BREAKING** removes cluster resource polling - workers will try to be placed and fail instead of avoiding placement attempts
- **BREAKING** by default, watchbot no longer sends notification emails each time a worker errors. You can opt-in to this behavior by setting `watchbot.template(options)` `.alarmOnEachFailure: true`.
- **BREAKING** no longer sends notifications on error interacting with SQS. Instead watchbot silently proceeds.
- **BREAKING** watcher log format has changed. Now watcher logs print JSON objects
- **BREAKING** removes `.notifyAfterRetries` option
- **BREAKING** removes `.backoff` option. Workers are always retried with exponential backoff
- **BREAKING** adds a dead letter queue. Messages received more than 14 times by a watcher container will be sent to this queue. Any visible messages in this queue will trip an alarm.

### 0.0.14

- Fix potential race condition when creating `LogForwarding`

### 0.0.13

- Adds EcsWatchbotVersion to template Metadata

### 0.0.12

- allow `workers` and `backoff` to be a ref
- adds `options.debugLogs` to enable verbose logging
- adds log stream prefix to organize worker/watcher logs better
- fix for worker role in reduce mode

### 0.0.11

- fixes a bug that could produce an invalid template if no memory reservation is specified. New default memory is 64MB
- fixes a bug that limited a watcher to maintaining at most 100 concurrent workers
- adds `reduce` option to `watchbot.template()` for tracking map-reduce operations
- adds example recipes for workers using `reduce` mode
- **Breaking** changes the `startedBy` attribute of worker tasks to the stack's name

### 0.0.10

- fixes a bug where `options.command` would break the watcher
- adds `.ref.queueUrl` and `.ref.queueArn` references to object returned by `watchbot.template()`
- automatically provide workers with permission to publish to watchbot's SNS topic
- adds `watchbot.logStream`, a node.js writable stream for prefixing logs
- **Breaking** changes the name of the SQS queue, making it a bit easier to find in the console

### 0.0.9

- fixes a template generation bug for callers that do not use mount points

### 0.0.8

- adds `logAggregationFunction` argument to watchbot.template
- allow caller to set container CMD
- template validation, cleanups, default watchbot version

### 0.0.7

- overhauls template building process, providing scripts that expose Watchbot's resources as JavaScript objects

### 0.0.6

- container logs are sent from Docker to CloudWatch Logs instead of syslog
- a watchbot stack creates its own CloudWatch LogGroup and sends all container logs to it
- on task failure, reads recent container logs from CloudWatch and includes them in notifications
- adds helper functions to run as part of the worker which help generate homogeneous, searchable log output

### 0.0.5

- silences `[status]` log messages unless logLevel is set to `debug`
- improved message body in notifications sent when task fail

### 0.0.4

- logs are sent to syslog instead of to a file assumed to be mounted from the host machine
- new template builder arguments to only include certain resources (e.g. webhooks) if you ask for them

### 0.0.3

- watcher pays attention to cluster resource reservation, avoids polling the queue when the cluster is fully utilized, and retries runTask requests if a request fails due to lack of memory.
- template sets up watcher permissions such that updates to the worker's task definition will not lead to permissions failures in the midst of a deploy

### 0.0.2

- watcher logs include message subject and body
- gracefully return messages to the queue if the ECS API fails to run a task
- handle situations where a single watcher receives the same message twice
- adjust alarm description in CloudFormation template
